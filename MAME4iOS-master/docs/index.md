## Summary

MAME stands for Multi Arcade Machine Emulator, and lets you play arcade games from the past 30+ years on a device that fits in your pocket! My teenage self from decades ago would be replaying that ["mind blown GIF"](https://media0.giphy.com/media/xT0xeJpnrWC4XWblEk/giphy.gif) over and over again, but that GIF did not exist back then.
